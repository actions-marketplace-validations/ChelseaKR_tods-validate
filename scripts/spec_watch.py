"""Diff the upstream TODS spec against `schema.py`'s hand transcription.

`schema.py` is transcribed by hand from the TODS specification
(`MobilityData/transit-operational-data-standard`, `docs/en/spec/index.md`).
Its own docstring says "If the spec and this file disagree, the spec wins" —
this script is the tripwire that catches disagreement before a human has to
notice it. It fetches (or reads) the spec markdown, parses its per-table
field definitions into `FieldSpec`-shaped records, and diffs them against
`tods_validate.schema.TABLES`, reporting added fields, removed fields, and
fields whose type/presence/enum values changed.

Scope: the spec spells out fields, one table per `### `filename.txt`` heading,
only for the TODS-specific files (today: `run_events.txt`,
`employee_run_dates.txt`, `vehicles.txt`, `vehicle_assignments.txt`).
Supplement files (`*_supplement.txt`) are documented as "fields match GTFS"
plus a handful of `TODS_`-prefixed additions listed in a separate flat table
keyed by filename, not a per-table field list — `schema.py` synthesizes their
`TableSpec.fields` from the GTFS field inventory, so a line-by-line diff
against a spec table isn't meaningful for them. This script only diffs
tables it actually finds a `### `filename.txt`` field table for; supplement
tables are out of scope by design, and a spec table found for a name not in
`TABLES` is reported as a newly-introduced table (drift).

Every report names what it compared. A tripwire that cannot say what it
looked at cannot be trusted when it says nothing is wrong: an unparseable
document used to yield zero tables, zero diffs, and "schema.py is in sync
with the upstream spec" at exit 0. A run that recognises no field table now
raises `SpecParseError`, and a run that reads some of the in-scope tables but
not all of them reports the gap and exits advisory rather than reporting
sync it did not establish.

Usage:
    python scripts/spec_watch.py
    python scripts/spec_watch.py --spec-file tests/fixtures/spec_watch/in_sync.md
    python scripts/spec_watch.py --format markdown

Exit codes:
    0  in sync, and every in-scope table was compared
    1  drift found (advisory signal for CI; never used to block a merge gate)
    2  the spec could not be fetched or parsed, or only some of the in-scope
       tables could be read (advisory: the comparison was skipped or partial)
