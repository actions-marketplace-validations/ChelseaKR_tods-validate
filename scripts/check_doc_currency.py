"""Fail when a currency-stamped document has changed since it was verified.

DOCUMENTATION-STANDARD §6.5: a document whose correctness depends on something
outside itself carries a ``Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD`` line and a
``Recheck cadence:`` line. ``docs/getting-started.md``, ``docs/api.md``,
``docs/read-api.md`` and ``docs/a11y/STATEMENT.md`` document commands and API
members that the code can move out from under, and had neither.

A date on its own is only a claim. This check makes the claim falsifiable: the
stamp records a fingerprint of the page as it was when someone verified it, and
this fails when the page has changed since. The date then means "this text was
checked", not "someone typed a date once". What it cannot check is whether the
verification was any good -- that part is a REVIEW gate, and the cadence line
says so.

Run by ``make docs-check`` (the ``docs-drift`` job in ci.yml).
