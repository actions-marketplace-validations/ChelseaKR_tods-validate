"""Every trigger that can publish to PyPI carries the same verification.

`.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml` runs on two events, and both of them
reach the `publish` job -- it declares no trigger condition. The verification
around it did not follow. `verify` was called with an empty `tag` outside a
release event, which silently disabled the two checks in `verify.yml` that are
gated on `inputs.tag != ''` (version consistency, and that the tag is an
annotated tag whose SSH signature verifies against the committed
`allowed_signers`), and `verify-published` -- the job that re-downloads what
actually landed on PyPI and checks its provenance -- carried
`if: github.event_name == 'release'`.

That is not a hypothesis. Run 31966563243 (2026-08-16, `workflow_dispatch`
from `main`) reports, from the API:

    verify / verify   success   step 12 "Version consistency (REL-03)"      skipped
                                step 13 "Tag is annotated and signed (…)"   skipped
    publish           success   <- a real PyPI upload
    verify-published  skipped
    run conclusion    success

A skipped job does not fail a run, so the whole thing reported green. A PyPI
upload cannot be withdrawn.

These assertions are structural rather than textual. They walk the `needs:`
closure instead of substring-matching a job name, because a substring test
passes on a workflow whose dependency has actually been cut; and they check
that no branch of the tag expression can evaluate to an empty string, rather
than that the expression is spelled a particular way.
