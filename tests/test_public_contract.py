"""The v1 public-contract snapshot is checked against the implementation.

``scripts/check_public_contract.py`` is a ``make verify`` gate, but until now it
reached CI only through the release workflows -- so the contract was verified
for the first time *after* a release tag was cut, and a change to a rule's
declared category could land on main with fully green CI. These tests run the
same comparison in the ordinary test suite, so the gate holds wherever the
suite runs, and pin the two fields that used to be compared against themselves.
