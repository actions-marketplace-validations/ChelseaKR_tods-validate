"""The memory budget is a gate, not a number in a document (FIX-04).

Same shape as `tests/test_perf_budget.py`, on the other axis: the measurement
is stubbed so the suite stays fast, and what the gate *does* with a
measurement is what gets pinned. The one test that does measure is the
end-to-end one, which is also the only place the ratio quoted in `SECURITY.md`
is checked against reality.
