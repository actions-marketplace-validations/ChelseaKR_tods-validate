"""Declared dependencies stay in the table that matches what they are.

CQ-27 in `docs/standards/CODE-QUALITY-STANDARD.md` asks that development
dependencies be declared in a PEP 735 `[dependency-groups]` table rather than
in `[project.optional-dependencies]`, "so linters/type-checkers never ship as
extras", and marks it AUTO-GATE. This is that gate. Without it the move is one
edit away from being undone, silently, by anyone adding a test dependency to
the table that reads most familiar.
