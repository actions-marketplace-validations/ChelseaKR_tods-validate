"""Apply safe, deterministic fixes to a TODS package.

The bar for a fix here is that its result is unambiguous and meaning-preserving,
so it can run unattended in a pipeline. Three transforms clear that bar:

- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from values (the TODS-W206 padding that
  stops IDs from matching their referents; the spec's own examples use it for
  column alignment).
- Drop rows that are entirely blank (a stray ``,,,`` past the header, which
  otherwise reports a wall of TODS-E201 missing-value errors).
- Drop rows that are byte-identical to an earlier row in the same file (pure
  redundancy, e.g. the TODS-W408 duplicate assignment). A row that shares a
  primary key but differs in any value is a real conflict and is left untouched.

Re-serializing also normalizes encoding to UTF-8 without a BOM. Anything whose
correct value a human must choose is left alone and reported by ``validate``.
