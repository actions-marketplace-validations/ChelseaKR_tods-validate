"""Handoff records: a go/no-go decision bound to the bytes it was made about.

The ``ingest-ready`` profile answers whether a CAD/AVL system should import a
feed, and ``--stamp`` says which tool version answered. Neither binds the
answer to the bytes. A handoff record does. It carries the SHA-256 of every
file in the package and in its companion GTFS feed, the settings the decision
was reached under, the coverage manifest, the merge manifest, and the decision
with the rule IDs behind it. ``handoff verify`` re-hashes what it is handed and
recomputes the record, so the receiving system can check that the record
describes the bytes it received instead of taking the sender's word for it.

What "accept" requires
----------------------
Nothing at or above the settings' ``fail-on`` severity, and every check that
wanted an input got one. A record made without a companion GTFS feed carries
"reject" whatever its findings say: its reference checks never ran, and a
go/no-go record that said "go" about references nobody resolved would be a
confident answer to a question nobody asked. That is ``--require-complete-run``'s
rule, and a handoff always applies it.

Why there is no timestamp
-------------------------
The record is a pure function of the input bytes, the settings and the tool
version, so ``verify`` can recompute it exactly and compare. A timestamp would
make every record unique and every recomputation a mismatch.
