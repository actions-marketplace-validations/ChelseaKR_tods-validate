"""The single gating decision shared by validate, diff, batch, and testing.

Every entry point ends the same way: findings come out of the rules, some are
withheld by ``--ignore`` (command line or config file), a baseline may narrow
what's left to only what's new, and what remains decides pass/fail against
``--fail-on``. That decision used to be hand-rolled once per subcommand (and a
fourth time in :mod:`tods_validate.testing`); duplicated policy logic drifts
apart one flag at a time. This module is the one place it lives now.
