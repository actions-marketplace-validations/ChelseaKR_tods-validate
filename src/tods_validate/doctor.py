"""``doctor``: one honest end-to-end pass.

Composes the existing pipeline stages -- validate, merge, (optionally)
MobilityData's gtfs-validator against the merged feed, and stats -- into a
single combined report. The whole point is honesty: a stage that could not
run (no companion GTFS, no Java, no gtfs-validator jar) is always labeled
SKIPPED with a specific reason, never silently dropped, so a report can never
be misread as "everything passed" when a stage simply did not execute.

The same rule applies one level down, inside the validate stage. It carries the
run's :class:`RunCoverage`, so a stage marked RAN also states how many of the
rule set actually ran and names what did not. Without it a TODS-only package --
16 of 44 checks skipped, 9 of them ERROR-severity -- rendered as "No problems
found." with nothing to distinguish it from a fully checked feed (#185).

The same rule governs the one document this module reads from another tool.
gtfs-validator's ``report.json`` is counted only when its shape is fully
understood; a report that parses as JSON but is shaped some other way is a
FAILED stage naming what could not be read, never zero notices (#147).

gtfs-validator is invoked only when java and a jar are already available on
this machine (``--gtfs-validator-jar`` or the ``GTFS_VALIDATOR_JAR`` env var).
This module never downloads it -- no surprise network access.
