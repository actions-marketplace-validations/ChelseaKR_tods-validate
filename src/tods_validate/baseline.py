"""Baseline and diff support.

A *baseline* is a previously captured set of findings (a JSON report written by
``--format json``). Comparing the current run against it answers "what changed?"
— which findings are new, which were fixed, which persist — so CI can fail only
on newly introduced problems and a consultant can show a client their progress.

Findings are identified by content fingerprint (``Finding.fingerprint()``): a
SHA-256 hash of the rule ID, file, field, and the rule's structured machine
context (``data`` — offending value, referenced ID, etc., from FIX-05), with
row number and message text deliberately excluded. Regenerating a feed and
inserting one row no longer marks every subsequent finding "new" and every
baseline entry "fixed" — the failure mode this replaces.

Honesty note: this is a heuristic, not an exact match. Two things still churn
identity even though nothing "moved":

* **Renumbered rows on a rule without machine context.** A rule that has not
  been migrated to populate ``data`` fingerprints on (rule_id, file, field)
  alone; multiple findings from that rule in the same file/field can collide
  onto the same fingerprint. Populating ``data`` (FIX-05) is what makes a
  rule's findings distinguishable independent of row number.
* **Revalued rows.** If a row's *content* changes — not just its position —
  the offending value (part of ``data``) changes too, so the fingerprint
  changes even though the row number may not have moved. This is correct
  (it is a different problem now) but worth knowing: "moved" below only
  covers position churn, not content churn.

Reports written before the fingerprint field existed (``reportVersion`` <
1.3.0) are still readable: ``load_baseline_identities`` recomputes the
fingerprint from ``data``/``file``/``field``/``rule_id`` when the stored
``fingerprint`` is missing, and falls back further to the legacy
(rule_id, pointer, message) identity for reports that predate ``data``
entirely.
