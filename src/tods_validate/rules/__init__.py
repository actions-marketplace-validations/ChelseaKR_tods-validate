"""Rule registry.

Rules are data plus a small check function, not a plugin framework. Each rule
has a stable ID, a severity, a spec citation, and a check that yields
findings. IDs keep the historical TODS- prefix and are grouped in bands:

- TODS-x1xx: package and file structure
- TODS-x2xx: field values within one file
- TODS-x3xx: references between files (including the companion GTFS feed)
- TODS-x4xx: semantic checks across rows

The letter encodes severity (E error, W warning, I info). IDs are never
reused or renumbered once released.
