"""Cross-file reference rules (TODS-x3xx).

Rules that resolve IDs into the companion GTFS feed run against the
"TODS-Supplemented GTFS": the GTFS files after supplement rows are applied.
Each check is gated on its target data actually being available, so a missing
companion file produces one clear finding instead of a flood of broken
references.

That gating is declared, not re-implemented per rule: each rule lists the GTFS
files it reads in ``gtfs_tables``, and the registry skips it -- visibly, in the
coverage manifest -- when the companion feed does not have them. So a rule body
here can assume its own files are present, and a rule that could not check
anything is never counted as one that ran. Checks that read several files
independently (TODS-W302, TODS-E314) still ask per file with the helpers below.
