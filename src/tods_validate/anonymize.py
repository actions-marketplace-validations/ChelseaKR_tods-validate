"""Pseudonymize person-identifying fields in a TODS package.

``employee_run_dates.txt`` carries ``employee_id``, and ``vehicles.txt`` can
carry ``license_plate`` and ``vehicle_label`` (typically the painted fleet
number, which correlates 1:1 with a pseudonymized ``vehicle_id`` for anyone
with a photo of the bus) — all personal/operational data an agency may not
want to publish when sharing a feed for research or a bug report. This
rewrites those fields to stable pseudonyms so the operational structure is
preserved (the same employee stays the same pseudonym throughout) while the
real identifiers are removed. Callers can pseudonymize additional extension
columns with ``--also FILE:FIELD`` (CLI) or the ``also`` parameter (library).

Pseudonyms are a salted SHA-256 truncation. With a random salt (the default)
the mapping is irreversible and not comparable across runs; pass a fixed salt
to keep pseudonyms stable across exports. This is pseudonymization, not a
guarantee of anonymity: correlation with other data may still re-identify
individuals. Treat the output accordingly.

Because pseudonymization only ever covers a known list of fields, every run
also reports what it did *not* touch: ``AnonymizeResult.carried_through``
lists every column, outside that list, that still holds non-enum data after
the rewrite (per the field types in ``schema.py``) — including numeric-looking
data such as a badge number or phone number, which is just as re-identifying
as text — the residual risk a caller may still need to strip or review by
hand.
