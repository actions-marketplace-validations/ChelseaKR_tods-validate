"""Render findings as text, JSON, Markdown, GitHub annotations, SARIF, or HTML.

Accessibility note: severity is always carried by a word (ERROR, WARNING,
INFO), never by color alone, so reports stay readable when piped to a file or
read by a screen reader. None of these renderers emit ANSI color, so output is
identical with or without ``NO_COLOR`` set.

Finding ordering is a stability contract: findings arrive sorted by file, then
row, then rule ID (see ``rules.validate``), and every renderer preserves that
order. Golden-file consumers can rely on it.

    findings table has a caption and column-scoped headers so a screen reader can
    navigate it; the page declares ``lang`` and a responsive viewport so it
    reflows on zoom; and the severity colors are chosen to clear WCAG AA contrast
    (4.5:1) in both light and dark color schemes (``prefers-color-scheme`` plus
    ``color-scheme: light dark`` on the root, so the report never renders light
    inside a dark host page). Landmarks (``header``/``main``) give assistive tech

    being usable, so findings are grouped into one collapsible ``<details>``

    ``by_rule(findings).most_common()`` — the same deterministic tie-break
    (first occurrence in the incoming file/row/rule-sorted list) used

    An inline, dependency-free ``<script>`` adds severity/rule/file filtering
    that toggles row and group visibility client-side; every control is a
    plain ``<select>``/``<input>`` rendered in the DOM, and a "Showing N of M
