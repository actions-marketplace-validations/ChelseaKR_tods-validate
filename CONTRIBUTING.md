# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution. `tods-validate` aims to be a validator
the TODS working group and everyday transit schedulers can rely on, so
correctness, clear findings, and honest spec citations matter more than feature
count.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.12 or newer. Dependencies are locked with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); CI installs from `uv.lock` with
`uv sync --frozen`, which also fails the build if the lockfile has drifted
from `pyproject.toml` (CQ-09). Using uv locally keeps your environment
identical to CI's:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ChelseaKR/tods-validate
cd tods-validate
uv sync --group dev
. .venv/bin/activate
pre-commit install
```

`pip install -e . --group dev` into your own venv still works if you would
rather not install uv (development dependencies are a PEP 735 dependency
group, which pip reads with `--group` from 25.1 onward, not an extra); just
regenerate `uv.lock` (`uv lock`) and commit it in the same PR if you touch
dependencies, so CI's lockfile-drift check stays green.

## The local gate

Before opening a PR, run the same checks CI enforces:

```sh
make verify
```

This reproduces, byte-for-byte, everything CI gates on: `ruff check`,
`ruff format --check`, `mypy`, `pytest --cov --cov-fail-under=90` (branch
coverage included), the `docs/rules.md` drift check, the i18n N/A
declaration check, `pip-audit --strict`, and a `gitleaks` secret scan. Run a
single stage with its own target (`make lint`, `make test`, `make audit`,
`make secrets`, ...); see the [Makefile](Makefile). Requires `pip-audit` and
`gitleaks` on `PATH` in addition to the `dev` dependency group
(`pip install -e . --group dev`; `gitleaks` is a Go binary, see
[github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#installing](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#installing)).

`pre-commit` runs ruff, ruff-format, mypy, and gitleaks on staged files, so
most of this is caught before you commit. Coverage (line and branch) is a
merge-blocking floor at 90%, and the docs-drift check fails CI if
`docs/rules.md` no longer matches the rule registry. The release workflows
re-run `make verify` at the tagged commit before anything publishes to PyPI,
GHCR, or GitHub Releases (see `.github/workflows/verify.yml`).

This repo also tracks the portfolio-wide engineering standards vendored at
[`docs/standards/`](docs/standards/); see the README's Standards Conformance
table and [docs/CONFORMANCE-GAPS.md](docs/CONFORMANCE-GAPS.md) for open
gaps against them.

## Rules and fixtures

This is a TODS validator, so most changes are rules. A rule has a stable ID
(`TODS-E203`, `TODS-W206`, `TODS-I108`; `E`/`W`/`I` for error, warning, info), a
severity, a spec citation, and a check function that yields `Finding` objects
carrying the file, row, field, message, and where relevant a suggested fix.

- **Every rule ships a passing and a failing fixture.** Add a minimal feed under
  `tests/fixtures/` that triggers the rule and one that does not, and a test in
  the matching `tests/test_*.py` module. See
  [docs/authoring-rules.md](docs/authoring-rules.md) for severity choice, ID
  allocation, message style, and the fixture and conformance contract.
- **Findings are the product.** A message says what is wrong, where, and what
  good looks like, in language a scheduler can act on, and cites the spec
  section it comes from. Prefer "run_events.txt row 4: end_time is '9:45', which
  is not a valid time. Use HH:MM:SS." over "invalid value in run_events".
- **Rule IDs are stable.** Downstream pipelines filter and suppress by ID, so do
  not renumber an existing rule. Allocate the next free ID in its band.
- **Regenerate the catalog.** After adding or changing a rule, run
  `python scripts/generate_rules_doc.py` and commit the updated
  `docs/rules.md`; CI fails if it drifts.
- **Do not invent spec details.** File names, field names, required or optional
  status, and enum values come from the current TODS spec, not from memory or
  analogy to GTFS. If the spec is ambiguous, implement the permissive reading
  and add a `docs/spec-questions.md` entry rather than guessing.

## House rules

- **No network at runtime.** Validation, merge, stats, and anonymize never make
  network requests; references resolve only against the local companion GTFS
  feed. Keep it that way (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).
- **Runtime dependencies stay minimal.** The core depends only on `click`.
  Heavier libraries belong behind an optional extra (the LSP server lives under
  the `lsp` extra), not in the default install path.
- **No real agency data.** Fixtures are hand-built and synthetic. Do not add a
  real feed, a real employee roster, or real vehicle identifiers to the repo or
  to an issue.
- **Honesty in claims.** The `anonymize` command pseudonymizes; it does not
  guarantee anonymity, and the docs say so. Keep claims to what the code does.

## Pull requests

- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `ci:`,
  `chore:`). PR titles follow the same convention.
- Keep PRs small and reviewable, even when working solo.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` when behavior changes, and regenerate `docs/rules.md`
  when a rule changes.
- Sign off your commits with the Developer Certificate of Origin
  ([developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

  ```sh
  git commit -s -m "feat: add TODS-W411 for ..."
  ```

  `-s` appends the `Signed-off-by:` trailer. By signing off you certify you
  wrote the contribution or have the right to submit it under the project's
  Apache-2.0 license.
