# Throughput benchmarks

`scripts/benchmark.py` generates a synthetic TODS+GTFS feed and times a single
validation pass over it, so regressions in the validation path (and the effect
of new rules) are visible as a rows/second number instead of a vague "it feels
slower."

## Methodology

`build_feed(directory, trips)` writes a self-consistent synthetic feed: one
`calendar.txt` service, 100 stops, `trips` trips (`trips.txt`), one run event
per trip plus its paired deadhead in `run_events.txt`, and a vehicle +
assignment per block (`blocks = max(1, trips // 10)`). The feed exercises
every rule band; the point of the benchmark is throughput, not whether the
feed is clean.

`total_rows` is defined as `trips * 2` — `trips.txt` rows plus `run_events.txt`
rows are what dominates the row count as `trips` scales, so that sum is the
denominator for the throughput figure. `stops.txt`, `vehicles.txt`, and
`vehicle_assignments.txt` stay small or scale with `blocks` (`trips // 10`),
not `trips`, so they're not counted.

The run is single-threaded: `runner.run(feed)` is called once and wrapped in
`time.perf_counter()`. There's no warm-up iteration and no averaging across
repeated runs — the number reported is one cold run per scale. `findings` is
the count of results the run produced (informational only; it is not part of
the throughput calculation).

Invocation:

```
.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark.py --trips <N>
```

## Environment

- Machine: Apple M1 Pro (arm64), Darwin 25.4.0
- Python: 3.12.13
- Package installed editable (`pip install -e .`) from a clean checkout, no
  optional extras

## Results

| trips | rows (trips × 2) | elapsed (s) | throughput (rows/s) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1,000 | 2,000 | 0.04 | 54,478 |
| 10,000 | 20,000 | 0.38 | 52,924 |
| 50,000 | 100,000 | 2.54 | 39,320 |
| 100,000 | 200,000 | 6.42 | 31,129 |

Raw output for the three published scales:

```
$ .venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark.py --trips 10000
trips:           10000
findings:        20000
elapsed:         0.38s
throughput:      52,924 rows/s

$ .venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark.py --trips 50000
trips:           50000
findings:        100000
elapsed:         2.54s
throughput:      39,320 rows/s

$ .venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark.py --trips 100000
trips:           100000
findings:        200000
elapsed:         6.42s
throughput:      31,129 rows/s
```

## Reading the numbers

Throughput drops as `trips` grows (roughly 54k rows/s at 1k trips down to
~31k rows/s at 100k trips) rather than holding flat, which points to
super-linear cost somewhere in the validation path (rule checks that scan
already-seen rows, cross-referencing that isn't indexed, etc.) rather than a
fixed per-run overhead. That's a profiling lead for future work, not
something this pass investigates further — the goal here is a published,
repeatable baseline to catch regressions against, not a performance
optimization.

## Reproducing

```
.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark.py --trips 1000
.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark.py --trips 10000
.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark.py --trips 50000
.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark.py --trips 100000
```

Numbers will vary by machine; re-run and update this table when the
validation path changes materially (new rules, changed data structures) so
regressions show up as a diff against a real baseline instead of folklore.

## Memory

Throughput was the only axis measured until 2026-08-27, which left the other
one running on an estimate: FIX-04 in `docs/ideation/02-large-scale-fixes.md`
guessed "roughly an order of magnitude over the raw bytes" and nobody had
checked. `scripts/check_memory_budget.py` measures it.

| Measure | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peak traced memory, full `run()` | **30.9x the input bytes** |
| Feed | 10,000-trip synthetic, 1,043,431 bytes |
| Interpreters | 30.90x on CPython 3.13.9, 30.53x on 3.12.14 |
| Budget | 1.03x growth against the committed ratio |

It measures `tracemalloc` peak rather than resident set size. RSS depends on
the allocator and the platform; traced peak counts the bytes the code asked
Python for, which is why this baseline, unlike `rowsPerCpuSecond`, is not tied
to a machine class. It is tied to an interpreter version, which
`perf/baseline.json` records.

The number was 36.6x before a per-file value pool landed in `loader.py`: equal
cells in one file now share one string, which on repetitive transit data is
most of them. Throughput was unchanged (65.9k against 65.0k rows/CPU-s, inside
the noise). The remaining gap to FIX-04's 3x goal is the per-row
`dict[str, str]`, which is open work.

What that means for the documented limits is in `SECURITY.md`: the loader's
512 MiB per-member and 2 GiB total ceilings bound extraction, not memory, and
at 31x they describe packages no ordinary machine can hold.

## Bundle size

`scripts/check_bundle_budget.py` holds the shipped HTML to committed byte
ceilings, recorded in `perf/bundle-baseline.json`.

| Surface | Measured | Budget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `web/index.html` | 11,513 | 12,288 |
| Whole published `web/` tree | 216,947 | 262,144 |
| Published page count | 47 | 60 |
| HTML report at 10,000 findings | 2,348,762 | 3,145,728 |

The `web/index.html` ceiling did not move when the share card landed. The
head advertised a title, a description and a URL and no image, so every share
of the playground arrived as grey text; the image tags cost 1.1 KiB and fit
under the existing 12,288 ceiling, leaving 6% headroom rather than 16%. That
is deliberate: this page is not supposed to grow, so the next addition of
this size gets argued for when it is needed. The 1200x630 PNG is a static
asset and does not enter either byte figure.

The last row is the one that can grow without anyone noticing: about 235 bytes
per finding, so a template change adding 80 bytes to a row is invisible on a
fixture and adds 800 KB to a report at the scale FIX-15 promises to survive.

## Reproducing any of this

`scripts/generate_feed.py` writes the feeds these numbers are measured on. Each
archive carries a `SYNTHETIC.md` label and a `synthetic_manifest.json` naming
its seed and parameters, and is byte-reproducible from that seed, so a
checksum identifies the exact bytes a published number came from. Since
EXP-13, `.github/workflows/release-corpus.yml` builds one archive per profile
(`clean-100k`, `drifted-gtfs`, `messy-export`) on every release, prints their
checksums into the job summary, and attaches them to the release. Before that
every number here cited a feed a reader could not obtain.

**These feeds are synthetic.** They are shaped like transit operations data
and are not evidence about how real feeds look; #76 is the open work to get a
real one.
